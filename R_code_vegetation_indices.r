# two main processes in dynamic ecosystem and chemical cycling
# first theromadynamics law: energy is conserved, and is lost from organisms as heat
# second law of thermodynamics: in a ecosystem, every exchange of energy increases the entropy of the universe. energy conversions are not completely efficient

# autotrophs build organic molecules themselves using photosynthesis or chemosynthesis as an energy source
# Heterotrophs depend on the biosynthetic utput of other organisms.
# autotrofi (produttori primari) erbivori (consumatori primari) carnivori(consumatori secondari) carnivori che mangiano altri carnivori (consumatori terziari)
# decomposers are consumers that derive their energy from detritus, non loving organic matter (prokariotes and fungi)
# decomposition connects all trophic levels
# primary production in an ecosystem is the amount of ight energy converted to chemical energy by utotrophs during a given time period.
# The extent of hotosynthetic production sets the spending limit or an ecosystem’s energy budget.
# The amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth’s urface limits photosynthetic output of ecosystems

# GPP--> GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION is the total carbon fixation by terrestrial ecosystems through vegetation photosynthesis
# NPP--> NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION is GPP minus energy used by primary producers for respiration NPP = GPP - RESPIRATION
# Standing crop is the total biomass of hotosynthetic autotrophs at a given time.

# Tropical rainforest, estuaries and coral reefs are among the most productive ecosystem per unit area.
##for this reason what we can do is mantaining a big monitoring of tropical forest since tropical forests are creating most of energy and biomass and chemical cycling
# Marine ecosystems are relatively unproductive per unit area but contribute for NPP cause of their volume

#how much of this biomass is been lost in time.
# how the energy is passing from an organisms to another
# biogeochemical cycles
